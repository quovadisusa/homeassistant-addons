# Home Assistant Add-On repository (by Quovadis USA)

This is really not for public use at this time, and I highly recommend that you not use this at this point. I'm a novice here and am trying to learn how to develop addons as I seek to update Eufy Security Cam system for my HomeAssistant instance. Of course this is heavily dependent on the work of others, as I have simply forked repositories that I found useful. The current repository depends heavily on the work of Max Winterstein, and I have forwarded his attributions here as well. If anything comes of this beyond my personal use, I'll update this.
